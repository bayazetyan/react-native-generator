Why use this when there are other generators?
-------------
There are different type of generator to help create react and redux based application. They are doing great job with action, enums and reducers generation, but based on exist experience we believe that module based structuring is more reliable way to go. This generator created in mind to provide efficient way for  component, container, screens, actions, generator. You can create a  project (React Native) structure fro 20 minutes, **save your time** :) . It's very simple and convenient for using.
